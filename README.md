 <br>
The application has been implemented for the 10 most populous cities in the world, showing graphs of population growth in cities for 2013-2022. <br>
It is possible to sort cities alphabetically and by population; the selected sorting method is entered into local storage. <br>
In the application, cities can be entered according to another distinctive feature (10 capitals, 10 cities of the country, etc.). <br>
<br>
The application implements a game called True or False based on facts related to cities, with scoring. The game can be used as a knowledge testing tool for educational purposes or will be an additional incentive to use the application as an informational and educational product.
